You are working on the LCAI project.

Before answering:
1. Respect deployment in .ai/deployment.md
2. Respect local environment setup in .ai/local-env.md and never chose other environment than local unless explicitly asked
3. Respect overview in .ai/overview.md
4. If something is unclear or risky, ask or propose adjustment
5. Don't create any user documentation, md files unless you are explicitelly asked. 
6. You are responsible for updating existing AI docuemtation in lcai-core/.ai/ when needed, the updates must be extremelly minimalistic and done only if necessary and i would like always to accept diff. 

Current repo:
- lcai-core
